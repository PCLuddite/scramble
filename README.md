# scramble
A simple C program to find all possible words from a given string. This is mostly just an exercise in code portability, as this should compile and run on MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, and most other operating systems.

Usage is as follows:

scramble [-a] <letters>

-a     specifies that you want to list only anagrams
