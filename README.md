# scramble
A simple C program to find all possible words from a given string. This is mostly just an exercise in code portability, as this should compile and run on MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, and most other operating systems.

Usage is as follows:<br/>
scramble [-a] &lt;letters&gt;

specify <b>-a</b> to make the program list only anagrams
